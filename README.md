# values-exercise
An excuse to turn a simple therapy exercise into a means of sharpening my programming skills.

The exercise becomes most effective with the restriction that the `Very Important` is only limited to 12 choices.

# Preamble

I was recommended the exercise found in [misc/Valuescards.pdf](misc/Valuescards.pdf), and while it's supposed to be done
by printing the papers and cutting them up, I thought it might be a good excuse to build it as a small web app to:

* Get my feet wet with [Figma](https://www.figma.com/)
* Do some project planning ([Linear?](https://linear.app/))
* Sharpen up my front-end skills
* Understand where the [React landscape is at in 2023](https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-starter/)
* Try out a new framework like [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
* Enhance the exercise by eventually building a means of being able to compare answers with another user

# Ideas

* Functionality to `Lock`/`Unlock` a Value, to mark it as something the user definitely knows they want to stay in a
particular column
* History of where Values were moved
Might help users see which Values they struggled with keeping in a particular column
