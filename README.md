# values-exercise
An excuse to turn a simple therapy exercise into a means of sharpening my programming skills.

# Preamble

I was recommended the exercise found in [misc/Valuescards.pdf](misc/Valuescards.pdf), and while it's supposed to be done
by printing the papers and cutting them up, I thought it might be a good excuse to build it as a small web app to:

* Get my feet wet with [Figma](https://www.figma.com/)
* Do some project planning ([Linear?](https://linear.app/))
* Sharpen up my front-end skills
* Try out a new framework like [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
* Enhance the exercise by eventually building a means of being able to compare answers with another user
