# Converting Valuescards.pdf to a JSON

First thing I needed to do was convert each relevant cell represneting a `Value` of the PDF to a JSON so I could
easily work with the data.

## PDF to Excel

Immediate thought was to convert it into an Excel file, and figured I could use my own company's tools for this:

The immediate result actually wasn't too bad, as seen in [Valuescards.from-xodo.xlsx](./intermediate-files-for-posterity/Valuescards.from-xodo.xlsx)
